# Chapter Two from the book "Head First Java" by Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates

## Chapter Two: Classes and Objects

### Classes and Objects

#### BULLET POINTS

- Object-oriented programming lets you extend
a program without having to touch previouslytested,
working code.
- All Java code is defined in a class.
- A class describes how to make an object of
that class type. A class is like a blueprint.
- An object can take care of itself; you don’t
have to know or care how the object does it.
- An object knows things and does things.
- Things an object knows about itself are called
instance variables. They represent the state
of an object.
- Things an object does are called methods.
They represent the behavior of an object.
- When you create a class, you may also want
to create a separate test class which you’ll
use to create objects of your new class type.
- A class can inherit instance variables and
methods from a more abstract superclass.
- At runtime, a Java program is nothing more
than objects ‘talking’ to other objects.
